Jakob Håkansson,2024_44,NOTES:,,"Hi Jakob. Here are some comments. I actually liked the snatch + hang snatch. Both the barbell path and acceleration were very good, the main limitation for that loads is the bottom position, especially the right foot/hip, and I also believe that is the reason of your right shoulder suffering, you likely need ""extra-work"" on that shoulder to compensate the foot/hip limitation. Because of this, we will focus on hip mobility in the warm-up for the next months. Also, if you want to do extra sessions, you can do the full routine explained in the first video. Furthermore, I want to add some specific work to strengthen your adductors, so I want you to perform the Copenhagen plank two times a week. You can decide when based on how much time do you have to spend in the gym after the lifts, look at the video and choose the level you feel comfortable to do 3 sets of 45"" seconds for each leg. About the lifts program, I think this will be the last ""volume"" week before a week of deload, but it will depend on how the week will go.",,,1,,,,,

Jakob Håkansson,2024_44,NOTES:,,"Hi Jakob. Here are some comments. I actually liked the snatch + hang snatch. Both the barbell path and acceleration were very good, the main limitation for that loads is the bottom position, especially the right foot/hip, and I also believe that is the reason of your right shoulder suffering, you likely need ""extra-work"" on that shoulder to compensate the foot/hip limitation. Because of this, we will focus on hip mobility in the warm-up for the next months. Also, if you want to do extra sessions, you can do the full routine explained in the first video. Furthermore, I want to add some specific work to strengthen your adductors, so I want you to perform the Copenhagen plank two times a week. You can decide when based on how much time do you have to spend in the gym after the lifts, look at the video and choose the level you feel comfortable to do 3 sets of 45"" seconds for each leg. About the lifts program, I think this will be the last ""volume"" week before a week of deload, but it will depend on how the week will go.",,,8,,,,,
